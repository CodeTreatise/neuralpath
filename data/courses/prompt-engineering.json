If you say 'make me food', they might hand you a raw potato. But if you say 'make me a grilled cheese sandwich with cheddar on sourdough, golden brown but not burnt' - you'll get exactly what you want.\n\n**The AI is the assistant. Your prompt is your request. Prompt engineering is learning how to ask clearly.**\n\nThat's it. That's the core concept. Everything else in this course builds on making your requests clearer, more specific, and more effective."

AI models process text as tokens, and there's a limit to how many they can handle.\n\n**System prompt**: Instructions that set up the AI's behavior before you start chatting (like 'You are a helpful coding assistant').\n\n**Few-shot learning**: Showing the AI examples of what you want before asking it to do the task."

The techniques work across all LLMs.\n\n**Q: Is this just about using ChatGPT better?**\nA: It starts there, but it goes much further. You'll learn to build applications, automate workflows, and create reliable AI systems.\n\n**Q: How long until I see improvement?**\nA: Immediately! The first lesson on 'Anatomy of a Prompt' will improve your results today.\n\n**Q: Why is it called 'engineering'?**\nA: Because like engineering, it's systematic.
